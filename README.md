# BMW - Broken Mouse Wheel
[Download Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/broken-mouse-wheel/)
### Current Version: v0.0.2
A Firefox add-on that allows users to scroll websites by moving the mouse, while holding the CTRL key.

This add-on allows you not only to completely substitute the use of the mouse wheel, but also to be faster. <br>
It also complements nicely the built-in `CTRL + LeftMouseClick` function, which opens a new tab for the clicked link. 

Incoming improvements: <br>
- Doesn't work well with infinite scroll websites <br>
- Smoother scrolling <br>
- Optimization to avoid unwanted scrolling (i.e. when you ctr+c) <br>
- Activate/Deactivate button
